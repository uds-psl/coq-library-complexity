# The Coq Library of Complexity Theory
[![build](https://github.com/uds-psl/coq-library-complexity/workflows/build/badge.svg?branch=coq-8.12)](https://github.com/uds-psl/coq-library-complexity/actions)

This library contains complexity theory. It is build upon the [Coq Library of Undecidability Proofs](https://github.com/uds-psl/coq-library-undecidability).

## How to build




<!---### Install from opam

Install the [A Coq Library of Undecidability Proofs](https://github.com/uds-psl/coq-library-undecidability), then install this.
--->
### Building from source

This library depends on the [Coq Library of Undecidability Proofs](https://github.com/uds-psl/coq-library-undecidability), and tehre are two ways to install that dependency:

Either, initialize the submodule of this git repository and install the library there using `make depsopam`. This only compiles the files actually needed by the complexity library.

Or use the `make depsopam` to install them using opam, which pins the undecidability library to a specific git hash. 


Then, the [Coq Library of Undecidability Proofs](https://github.com/uds-psl/coq-library-undecidability)is included as a submodule in `./coq-library-undecidability`.

- `make all` builds the library and the dependencies
- `make depssubmodule` builds the dependencies by itself using the submodule
- `make depsopam` builds the dependencies using opam
- `make html` generates clickable coqdoc `.html` in the `website` subdirectory
- `make clean` removes all build files in `theories` and `.html` files in the `website` directory
- `make realclean` removes the build files of the dependencies as well as everything `make clean` removes

### Troubleshooting

#### Coq version

Be careful that this branch only compiles under Coq 8.12.

We make heavy use of the following results, which for technical reasons are oursourced to the Library of Undecidability Proofs.

We use two Frameworks they ease resource analysis and computability proofs for call-by-value lambda-calculus and Turing machines:
